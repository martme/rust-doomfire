# Doom Fire Effect for Windows Desktop

Inspired by [Fabien Sanglard's excellent writeup](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/) of how the Doom fire effect was implemented, this repository aims to bring the classic firey experience to your Windows desktop!

Implemented using WinAPI and Rust; because why not?

## Getting started

Compile and run using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on a Windows computer

```bash
cargo run
```

## Limitations

Known to be a bit buggy if you are using a display scale other than 100%.
